# Envelove

A little thing created by me from an open-sources repo by @elifandcode

This was made for my crush, and I tend to keep this repo private.

    -- The envelop are the words I want to tell you, that I love you, and miss you. It has been already 2 months since the day I left. I wish to have more time to meet you, to see you--
